	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src='/Me.jpg' alt="Austen Maccherone" width="100%"/>
	<p>
		My passion for creation and innovation is what drives me to work
		and the results never fail to shock and amaze me. I love nature,
		it is something that is fabricated within all of us. There is a 
		power in the intuition carved into the mind. My opinionated personality
		and exaggerated nature are what bring my ideas to life.

	<h1>About this website</h1>

	<p>
		This website was created using the
		<a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit starter template </a>
		using the following command line and following the prompts:
	</p>

	<pre>npm create svelte@latest</pre>

	<p>
		Then I built a carousel component by getting inspiration from
		<a href="https://github.com/E01T/simple-svelte-slideshow">Simple Svelte Slideshow</a>
		component
	</p>
